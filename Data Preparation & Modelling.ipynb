Not too bad, actually. But recall, which is precision in predicting where the customer has churned, isn't too great. Recall measures, how much positive samples of our dataset did we identify correct. And recall[1] is actually at 49%, which is not that great. It is easy to get recall[0] (90%), because there are lot more data in this sample. Unfortunately we are not trying to get this one.
